# food_trucks
A command-line program that outputs a list of food trucks given a source of food truck data from the San Francisco government's API. 

# Dependencies
Other than using Python's built-in libraries (requests, datetime and sys) there are no other third party dependencies needed to run the program.
However, Python3 is required to run this program.
    
# Running the program
After you have verified that Python3 is installed correctly, run this in the command line: `python3 show_open_food_trucks.py`
